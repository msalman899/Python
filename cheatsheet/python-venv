# Creating python virtual environment via traditional way

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p /bin/python2.7 project_py2.7    # this will create a virtual env "project_py2.7" with python version 2.7
virtualenv -p /bin/python3.8 project_py3.8    # this will create a virtual env "project_py3.8" with python version 3.8
source project_py2.7/bin/activate             # this will activate the virtual env (you are now in virtual env)
deactivate                                    # this will get you out of venv 
rm -rf project_py2.7                             # deleting the venv dir will remove the venv

pip freeze > requirements.txt    # this will create a file with all the packages currently being used in the venv
pip install -r requirements.txt  # you can run this in any of new vnenv and install all of the packages in requirements.txt

# Creating python virtual environment via recommended way "pipenv"

    # this will create a virtual env "myproject"
pipenv shell                   # this will activate the virtual env (you are now in virtual env)
exit                           # this will get you out of venv 
              # deleting the venv dir will remove the venv


Tips:
1 - Never put your code in venv because you can renmove venv any time if needed. venv is just like an environment where you can run your code with some certain packages versions.
e.g 
My_Project
 - venv
   - My_Project_py2
     - bin/activate
     - code
   - My_Project_py3
     - bin/activate
     - code
