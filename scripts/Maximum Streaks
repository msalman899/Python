Problem - 

A coin was tossed numerous times. You need to find the longest streak of tosses resulting  and the longest streak of tosses resulting in .Formally, given the results of n tosses of a coin, find the maximum number of consecutive HEADS and the maximum number of consecutive TAILs.

-- Solution 

def getMaxStreaks(toss):
    hs,ts=0,0
    ahs,ats=[],[]
    for i in toss:
        if i == "Heads": 
            ts = 0
            hs += 1
        else:
            hs = 0
            ts += 1
        ats.append(ts)
        ahs.append(hs)
    return [max(ahs),max(ats)]
